<h1>A statistical analysis on storks delivering babies</h1>

The paper "Storks Deliver Babies" (Matthews,2000) critiques the misuse and misinterpretation of statistical correlations, particularly the common pitfall of equating correlation with causation. In this paper, data shows a statistically significant correlation between the number of storks and birth rates across various regions. The paper uses this improbable example of storks delivering babies to illustrate how a suggestion of a "significant" association, should not be interpreted as evidence of a causal relationship. 

This notebook seeks to expand upon the paper, using the original dataset from the paper and implementing boostrapping and regression analyses with additional variables to expand upon the conclusions drawn within the paper: that the usual interpretation of values given from statistical analysis does not prove that storks deliver babies.
